The Humble and Pious Platform:
Introducing IHS Token for Global Donations 

Abstract: the "Humble and Pious Platform," a new system that aims to transform the way we contribute to charitable causes. In a time when trust in the charitable sector is significantly undermined, establishing a strong bond of trust with donors has never been more crucial. This whitepaper presents an in-depth exploration of the Humble and Pious Platform," a transformative initiative built on the Avalanche ecosystem. Central to this platform is the IHS (IESUS HOMO SALVATOR) token, a native cryptocurrency designed with the primary objective of facilitating the collection and distribution of global donations.
